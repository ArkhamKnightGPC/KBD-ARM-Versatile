# KBD-ARM-Versatile
Experiment involving keyboard data reception using the ***gcc-arm-none-eabi*** toolchain and the ***qemu-system-arm*** system.

Project for the course PCS 3732 Microprocessor Laboratory 2022 ([pcs.usp.br/~jkinoshi](https://www2.pcs.usp.br/~jkinoshi/2022/labmicro-22.html)), based on the book ***Embedded and Real Time Systems, K.C Wang***.

The experiment consists of building two projects from a base project. The main directory contains the base project.

The first project built in the experiment can be run by running the **mk.sh** script from the Activity3 (***Atividade3**) directory. In this activity we print each character typed into the keyboard.

The second project built in the experiment can be run by running the **mk.sh** script from the Challenge (***Desafio**) directory. In this activity we read the whole line and print the input only at the end of line.
